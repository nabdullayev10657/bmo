# Setup

Use python 3.7, because that's the latest one (as of time of writing) where numpy works out of the box on raspberry pi

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and fill the env vars. Get the OpenAI key on OpenAI's website, and Picovoice key from Picovoice Console (https://console.picovoice.ai/)
